This example problem is of a large-angle Ni [001] symmetric tilt grain boundary -- Sigma37 (570).  The structure in the data file has been thermostated at 400K in a separte simulation using the Foiles and Hoyt embedded atom method potential (Acta Mat, 2006) .  The SAED example generates a full 3D recipral map of diffraction intensities.  The SAED-XRD example also includes a diffraction pattern from 2theta = 10-100 using a 250 bins.
