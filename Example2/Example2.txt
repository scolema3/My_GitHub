Example 2 generates diffraction patterns for a alpha-Al2O3 (0001) slab -- modeled with the ReaxFF potential (van Duin et al., 2003 & Sen et al., 2013).  The example generates 2 sets of diffraction data using (1) all atoms and (2) atoms within just the top 1/4 of the slab.  VTK formated files contain 3d diffraction intensities within reciprical space that can be used to mimic selelected area diffraction patterns by taking appropriate slices within a visualization software.  Also, x-ray difffaction profiles are created for the 2 regions between 2theta 10 and 100.  The outputted xrd data is binned based on the 1theta angle in radians.
