[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates electron diffraction intensity as 
described in "(Coleman)"_#Coleman on a mesh of reciprocal lattice nodes 
defined by the entire simulation domain (or manually) using simulated 
radiation of wavelength lambda. 

The electron diffraction intensity I at each reciprocal lattice point 
is computed from the the structure factor F using the equations:

:c,image(Eqs/compute_xrd1.jpg) // I=F*F
:c,image(Eqs/compute_xrd2.jpg) // F=sum()

Here, K is the location of the reciprocal lattice node, rj is the 
postion of each atom, fj are atomic scattering factors.

Diffraction intinsities are calculated on a three-dimensional mesh of 
reciprocal lattice nodes. The mesh spacing is defined either (I)  by 
the entire simulation domain or (II) manually.

For a mesh defined by the simulation domain, a rectilinar grid is 
constructed with spacing {c}*inv(A) along each reciprocal lattice 
axis. Where A are the vectors corresponding to the edges of the 
simulation cell. If the {manual} flag is included, the mesh of 
recirpocal lattice nodes will defined using the {c} values for the 
spacing along each reciprocal lattice axis. Note that manual mapping 
of the reciprocal space mesh is good for comparing diffraction results 
from  multiple simulations; however it can reduce the likelihood that 
Bragg reflections will be satisfied unless small spacing paramaters 
(~0.05) are implemented.

The limits of the reciprocal lattice mesh are determined by the use of 
the {Kmax}, {Zone}, and {dR_Ewald} paramaters.  The rectilinear mesh 
created about the origin of reciprocal space is terminated at the 
boundary of a sphere of radius {Kmax} centered at the origin.  If 
{Zone} paramaters z1=z2=z3=0 are used, diffraction intensities are 
computed thoughout the entire spherical volume - note this can greatly 
increase the cost of computation.  Otherwise, {Zone} paramaters will 
denote the z1=h, z2=k, and z3=l (in a global since) zone axis of an 
intersecting Ewald sphere.  Diffraction intensities will only be 
computed at the intersection of the reciprocal lattice mesh and a 
{dR_Ewald} thick surface of the Ewald sphere.

The atomic scattering factors, fj, accounts for the reduction in 
diffraction intensity due to Compton scattering.  Compute saed uses 
analytical approximations of the atomic scatteirng factors that vary 
for each atom type (type1 type2 ... typeN) and angle of diffraqtion.  
The analytic approximateion is computed using the formula

Coeffiecents paramaterized by "(Fox)"_#Fox are assigned for each 
atom type designating the chemical symbol and charge of each atom 
type. Valid chemical symbols for compute saed are:

If the {echo} keyword is specified, compute saed will provide extra 
reporting information to the screeen.  

[Output info:]

This compute calculates a global vector.  The length of the vector is 
the number of reciprocal lattice nodes that are explored by the mesh.  
The entries of the global vector are the computed diffraction 
intensities as discribed above.

The vector can be accessed by any command that uses global values
from a compute as input.  See "this
section"_Section_howto.html#howto_15 for an overview of LAMMPS output
options.

All array values calculated by this compute are "intensive".  

[Restrictions:] 

The compute_saed command does not work for triclinic cells.
