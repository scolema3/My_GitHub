LAMMPS
======

Here I'm incorporating virutal selected area electron difraction (SAED) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) capabilities into the stock LAMMPS MD package (lammps.sandia.gov).  For more details regarding the physics and particular methods used in these changes see the article by Coleman, Spearot, and Capolongo (2013) http://iopscience.iop.org/0965-0393/21/5/055020/.
